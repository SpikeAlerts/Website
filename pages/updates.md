# Updates

We will aim to update this weekly on Wednesdays! 

## 2-7-2024

The base (updating sensors & alerts) of [version 2.0](https://github.com/SpikeAlerts/SpikeAlerts)) runs smooth. We've also made an informational brochure for distributing at community events, schools, etc.

Next week we'll start working on updating the website, adding the Points of Interest extension (POIs formerly "Sign Up Information"), and developing flask apps (API and webmap).

## 1-31-2024

Paused overnight alerts and removed "SpikeAlert" from all messages. Significant work on code organization/modulation ([Repository](https://github.com/SpikeAlerts/SpikeAlerts)) - the new version should be ready for testing mid-to-late February. 


## 1-24-2024

Version 2.0 is in progress! In March we will message when it's ready with a new sign-up form and then terminate version 1.

Currently, we are working on: materials for outreach; organizing researcher/programmer collaboration; investigating other sensors to incorporate into the system; and getting feedback for development of SpikeAlerts2.0

So far, our priorities for this next version include:

- Improving the "user experience"
- Translating all messaging into Spanish
- Including more educational resources and project documentation on website
- Making data publicly available in real-time
- Ensuring that reports are directed to agencies in the most actionable and timely manner
- Improving git structure and code organization for collaboration with other cities
