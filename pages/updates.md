# Updates

We will aim to update this weekly on Wednesdays!

## 3-8-2024

It's been an exciting week! 

The new website is coming together complete with our own webmaps (see example below) while the "Users & Notifications" extension of SpikeAlerts has been tested. This extension was pulled into the [Minneapolis instance](https://github.com/SpikeAlerts/SpikeAlerts_Mpls) for implementing SMS Messaging and REDCap scripts. 

A new sign-up form should be finished today and sent out to a focus group. Trial run to begin next week!

## 2-29-2024

Apologies for the delay in writing an update. Last week battling illness, this week playing catch up.

[REDCap](https://ctsi.umn.edu/tools/redcap) is undergoing a big update this weekend, and we won't be able to look up any phone numbers. So no SpikeAlerts from Friday to Monday, unfortunately. We'll still be watching the sensors, though!

In other news, we're getting very close to testing the new version! The workflow to monitor the sensors, create/delete alerts, and  check "Places of Interest" has been tested and runs smooth. The last piece of the puzzle is the "Users & Notifications" extension of the project which is quickly falling into place. 

Next week we'll be intensively working on the new website and organizing a focus group to test the new version! 

## 2-14-2024

[Version 2.0](https://github.com/SpikeAlerts/SpikeAlerts) has the full workflow public on Github. A little more documentation/testing and development of the "Users & Notifications" extension then we will fork this and begin developing the Minneapolis instance of SpikeAlerts (SpikeAlerts_Mpls)! This is where we can start the work to include all of the user feedback we've received!

We noticed that our SpikeMovies were getting viewed/downloaded too much, and Google throttled our Drive. The workaround (for now) is having a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SpikeAlerts) for folks to view. Download links will be sent upon request.

Lastly, the lead developers discussed serving our own website for SpikeAlerts_Mpls complete with a webmap of the real-time information (and potentially a discussion board). This website will then transition into more of a landing page for the greater SpikeAlerts project. To begin early March.

## 2-7-2024

The base of [version 2.0](https://github.com/SpikeAlerts/SpikeAlerts) runs smooth (up to updating alerts). We've also made an informational brochure for distributing at community events, schools, etc.

Next week we'll start working on updating the website, adding the Places of Interest (POIs formerly "Sign Up Information") & Reports, and developing flask apps (API and webmap).

## 1-31-2024

Paused overnight alerts and removed "SpikeAlert" from all messages. Significant work on code organization/modulation ([Repository](https://github.com/SpikeAlerts/SpikeAlerts)) - the new version should be ready for testing late February. 


## 1-24-2024

Version 2.0 is in progress! In March we will message when it's ready with a new sign-up form and then terminate version 1.

Currently, we are working on: materials for outreach; organizing researcher/programmer collaboration; investigating other sensors to incorporate into the system; and getting feedback for development of SpikeAlerts2.0

So far, our priorities for this next version include:

- Improving the "user experience"
- Translating all messaging into Spanish
- Including more educational resources and project documentation on website
- Making data publicly available in real-time
- Ensuring that reports are directed to agencies in the most actionable and timely manner
- Improving git structure and code organization for collaboration with other cities
