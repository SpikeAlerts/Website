# Updates

We will aim to update this weekly on Wednesdays moving forward! 

## 1-24-2024

Currently, we are working on materials for outreach, organizing researcher collaboration, investigating other sensors to incorporate into the system, and getting feedback from folks for development of SpikeAlerts2.0

So far, our priorities for this next version include:

- Improving the "user experience"
- Translating all messaging into Spanish
- Including more educational resources on website and within messages
- Making data publicly available in real-time
- Ensuring that reports are directed to agencies in the most actionable and timely manner
- Improving git structure and code organization for collaboration with other cities
