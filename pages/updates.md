# Updates

We will aim to update this weekly on Wednesdays! 

## 1-24-2024

Version 2.0 is in progress! In March we will message when it's ready with a new sign-up form and then terminate version 1.

Currently, we are working on: materials for outreach; organizing researcher/programmer collaboration; investigating other sensors to incorporate into the system; and getting feedback for development of SpikeAlerts2.0

So far, our priorities for this next version include:

- Improving the "user experience"
- Translating all messaging into Spanish
- Including more educational resources and project documentation on website
- Making data publicly available in real-time
- Ensuring that reports are directed to agencies in the most actionable and timely manner
- Improving git structure and code organization for collaboration with other cities
