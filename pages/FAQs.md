<summary><h2>What is a SpikeAlert?</h2>
</summary>

A "SpikeAlert" is a warning that air quality <b>may</b> be harmful in your area. 
This is tough to define, and we hope to get a better idea with your help!

<br><br>

Currently, we are sending out alerts when a <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/">PurpleAir</a> sensor reads 10-minute average Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) levels over the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/national-ambient-air-quality-standards-naaqs-pm" target="_blank">24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard</a> (NAAQS) within 1 kilometer of your designated location of interest.

<summary><h2>What is PM2.5?</h2>
</summary>

Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a major <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-and-health/health-impacts/types-of-pollutants" target="_blank">air pollutant</a> of concern.

<br><br>

PM2.5 are generic particles of 2.5 micrometers in diameter (or smaller) that are created during the combustion processes of cars, energy production, manufacturing, and trash incineration as well as forest fires, backyard bonfires, and small gas engines! 

<br><br>

The American Heart Association (AHA) has established a causal link between these particles and heart and lung disease (<a href="https://hpforhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HPHC_factsheet_AirPollution.pdf">Source</a>).

<!-- Example Question -->

<details>
<summary><h2>Are reports anonymous?</h2>
</summary>

The app's database intentionally "unrelates" user information when archiving reports. Reports record the time of event and nearby sensors but not the user's location/phone number.
