<summary><h2>What is a SpikeAlert?</h2>
</summary>

A "SpikeAlert" is a warning that air quality <b>may</b> be harmful in your area. 
This is tough to define, and we hope to get a better idea with your help!

<br><br>

Currently, we are sending out alerts when a <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/">PurpleAir</a> sensor reads 10-minute average Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) levels over the <a href="https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/osti-modeling/air-quality/faqs#aqitable" target="_blank">24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard</a> (NAAQS) within 800 meters of your designated place of interest.

<summary><h2>What is PM2.5?</h2>
</summary>

Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) is a major <a href="https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/air-quality-and-health/health-impacts/types-of-pollutants" target="_blank">air pollutant</a> of concern.

<br><br>

PM2.5 are generic particles of 2.5 micrometers in diameter (or smaller) that are created during the combustion processes of cars, energy production, manufacturing, and trash incineration as well as forest fires, backyard bonfires, and small gas engines! 

<br><br>

The American Heart Association (AHA) has established a causal link between these particles and heart and lung disease (<a href="https://hpforhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HPHC_factsheet_AirPollution.pdf">Source</a>).

<br><br>

If you or someone you know would be interested in hosting a sensor you can request one from the City <a href="https://www.minneapolismn.gov/government/programs-initiatives/environmental-programs/air-quality/host-air-sensor/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br><br>

In the meantime, we're working on city-wide air quality alerts.

<h1><b>Privacy</b></h1>

<!-- Example Question -->
<details>
<summary><h2>What happens to a report?</h2>
</summary>

We're still thinking this through...

Currently, folks get the option to report through a text message and/or the [webmap](https://www.mplsaqalert.com/map/). These are anonymous. We'll forward them weekly to relevant community organizations, researchers, the Minneapolis Health Department (MHD), and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). 

Would it be cool to have them appear on a map as well? Would love feedback/ideas!
